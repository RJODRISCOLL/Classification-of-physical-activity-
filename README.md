The ability to classify physical activity in free-living individuals is of great scientific interest to the life sciences. Wearable technologies, relying predominantly on accelerometer output, have been used extensively in research environments; the Sensewear Armbands and the IDEEA activity monitoring system are two notable and extinct examples. The appeal of wearable technologies is in their objectivity, they are not plagued by the bias which renders self-report questionnaires close to useless.  The challenge with wearable devices lies in translating raw sensor outputs to accurate and precise measurements with biological and behavioural meaning. This challenge is not easily overcome and traditional linear models are limited in their ability to capture the variability of human movement. Machine learning approaches are showing great promise for the assessment of physical activity.

The purpose of this post is to explore the accuracy of popular machine learning algorithms for the classification of physical activity sensor outputs. You can view the Markdown file [here](http://rpubs.com/rudriscube/PAclassification)
